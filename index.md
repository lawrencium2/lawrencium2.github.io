### CPSC 120

* Lab 12

    Lab 12 was a program that used GraphicsMagick's API to create images. However, the journey was marked by challenges due to syntax errors that made compiling the code difficult. This experience underscored the importance of precise labeling and clear structuring, especially when dealing with complex functions. I enjoyed how we utilized images in this lab. I had a particularly difficult time with syntax errors. The compiling process was made me understand the importance of labeling factors esepcially in a multifaceted function. 
  
* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was a simple hello world. This felt like a very important lesson to me, especially since it was my first lab learning C++. The introduction of C++ and it's complex language was interesting as a student who did not know anything about the language yet. Learning the functionality of the language.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4 was a program that introduced conditional statements such as while and if functions. This helped me prepare for further complexities in my programming as well as creating a foundation of my programming experience. The Hi-Lo game implemented conceptually conditions, but the abstraction of what these functions can do in computer science are vast.+
