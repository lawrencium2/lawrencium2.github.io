### CPSC 120

* Lab 12

    Lab 12 was a program that used GraphicsMagick's API to create imaes. I enjoyed how we utilized images in this lab. I had a particularly difficult time with syntax errors. The compiling process seemed a little different.
  
* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was a simple hello world. This felt like a very important lesson to me, especially since it was my first lab learning C++. The introduction of C++ and it's complex language was interesting as a student who did not know anything about the language yet. Learning the functionality of the language.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4 was a program that introduced conditional statements such as while and if functions. This helped me prepare for further complexities in my programming as well as creating a foundation of my programming experience. The Hi-Lo game implemented conceptually conditions, but the abstraction of what these functions can do in computer science are vast.
